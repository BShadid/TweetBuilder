## Abstract

This script fetches tweets about a user-specified topic, constructs a network of related words, and allows the user to build their own tweet using a recursive correlation tree. Once the character limit is reached or no words are closely related, the user has the option to tweet their creation.

## Disclaimer

This project will be using the tweepy python package to interact with the
twitter's API. It will also use John Zelle's graphics.py library. Both are
available for free use under the MIT License and the GNU Project Free 
Software License, respectively.
